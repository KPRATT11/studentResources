# Week 1 - Part 1

## Outcomes 
- Understand how to use `create-react-app` to create a new React App
- Understand what JSX is 

### create-react-app 
In order to create a starter react app we can use the too `create-react-app` https://create-react-app.dev/

We can run this tool by using the command 
```sh 
yarn create react-app {appName}
```` 

once we have changed directory into our newly created folder 
```sh
cd {appName}
```

we can run the app by using the command 
```sh
yarn run
```
and opening up `localhost:3000`

### JSX 
JSX also known as "Javascript XML" is the HTML like syntax we use in react. However it is important to note that even though it looks like HTML it is it's own thing. 

It is also important to note that JSX on it's own is not valid Javascript, it is *transpiled* into Javascript
